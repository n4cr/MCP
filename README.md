# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized approach to managing and optimizing context windows for large language models (LLMs). It aims to improve the efficiency, consistency, and effectiveness of LLM interactions.

## Key Features
- Dynamic context window optimization
- Context-aware prompt management
- Efficient token utilization
- Structured context retrieval
- Adaptive context prioritization

## Technical Specifications
- Designed for scalable LLM interactions
- Flexible integration capabilities
- Cross-model compatibility

## Implementation
- Open standards-based approach
- Modular architecture
- API specifications

## Getting Started
Detailed documentation and implementation guides will be provided soon.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions to the MCP to help improve and evolve the protocol. Please see our contributing guidelines for more information.
