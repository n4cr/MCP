# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized approach to managing and optimizing context windows for large language models (LLMs). It aims to improve the efficiency, consistency, and effectiveness of LLM interactions.

## Key Features
- Dynamic context window optimization
- Context-aware prompt management
- Efficient token utilization
- Structured context retrieval
- Adaptive context prioritization

## Technical Specifications
- Designed for scalable LLM interactions
- Flexible integration capabilities
- Cross-model compatibility

## Implementation
- Open standards-based approach
- Modular architecture
- API specifications

## Todo Application
This repository includes a Flask-based Todo application as a practical implementation example. The application features:

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for todos
- SQLite database for data persistence
- Clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Task completion tracking
- Timestamp recording

### Running the Todo App
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Getting Started
Detailed documentation and implementation guides will be provided soon.
